## [0.1.0] - 2025-Dec-23

### Added

- Added a configuration file under `BepInEx/config/FleesDedicatedServer.cfg` as an additional option to specify dedicated server settings
- Added an option to schedule a server restart after a specified amount of time
  - The automatic restart can be configured to go through only when the server player count drops below a certain percentage of the maximum player count
  - The time interval is specified in the `[XXd][XXh][XXm][XXs]` format, such as `4h` for 4 hours, `1d6h30m` for 1 day, 6 hours and 30 minutes, etc.
  - The minimum time interval is 30 minutes
- Added `/restart` to the server console - this will restart the server after 20 seconds have elapsed
- Added `/cancelrt` - this command and `/cancelsd` will cancel a pending server shutdown or restart
- The mod will now generate `start_dedicated_server.cmd` on Windows and `start_dedicated_server.sh` on Linux with Proton
  - These scripts can be used to launch a dedicated server directly instead of having to specify launch options through Steam
  - You will need to first launch the game normally using this mod for those scripts to appear or be updated
- The mod will now generate `steam_appid.txt` to allow to boot the game without going through the Steam Client

### Changed
